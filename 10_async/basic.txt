sync in JS
-----------

synchronous
--> code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. each instructions wait for the previous instructions to complete its execution


Asynchronous
--> Due to synchronous programming , sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions , which causes a delay in the UI.
--> Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesnt block the flow.


Callbacks
--------------------

A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function



Callback Hell
--------------------
Callback Hell :Nested Callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure(pyramid of Doom)

This style of programming becomes difficult to understand and manage.
